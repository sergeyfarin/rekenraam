# Conventions

This document fixes cross-cutting product, engineering, and workflow conventions for the active Go and SvelteKit codebase.

## Source Of Truth

- Active requirements live in `docs/product-requirements.md`.
- Active architecture rules live in `docs/early-architecture-decisions.md`.
- Active sequencing lives in `docs/product-requirements.md`.
- Archive review planning lives in `docs/archive-requirements-review.md`.
- `.archive/` is historical reference only.

When a feature introduces a durable new rule, update one of those documents in the same change.

## Delivery Model

- Build one feature slice at a time.
- Each slice must leave the app runnable.
- Avoid hidden partial migrations from `.archive/`.
- Prefer the smallest viable durable implementation over speculative abstractions.
- Keep single-user assumptions explicit until a later ADR changes them.

## Product Naming And Domain Model

- A book is the top-level accounting boundary.
- Accounts form a tree.
- Account types are asset, liability, equity, income, and expense.
- Categories are UI concepts mapped to income and expense accounts, not a separate ledger primitive.
- Transactions contain postings or splits.
- Transfers are ordinary transactions.
- Reconciliation status belongs to posting or account-specific ledger state, not only a transaction header.

## Data And Persistence Conventions

- Never store money or quantities as floating point.
- Store exact values as integer plus scale plus commodity code.
- Use calendar dates for financial facts.
- Use UTC timestamps for system facts.
- Calendar dates travel over the wire as ISO 8601 strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`). UTC timestamps travel as RFC 3339 strings (`2025-01-15T14:30:00Z`). Go's `time.Time` marshals as RFC 3339 by default; use a plain `string` or a validated date type for calendar-date fields.
- Keep stable codes in data; translated labels belong in localization assets.
- Built-in records not entered by users or imported from external sources must use stable keys or codes, not English display names as the only source of truth.
- Seeded categories, account types, currencies, commodities, system accounts, and other app-defined labels must be localization-ready.
- Preserve `book_id` in core schema even while runtime stays single-book.
- Use state transitions, voiding, archival, or corrective entries instead of hard-deleting business records.
- Soft-delete column convention and the specific schema pattern (e.g., `deleted_at` vs `archived_at` vs a status enum) will be documented when first introduced in a migration. Consistency across tables is required; do not mix approaches.
- Schema changes require explicit migrations under `backend/migrations`.
- The migration runner is **`pressly/goose`** with embedded SQL files. Migrations are sequential numbered `.sql` files under `backend/migrations/`. Run at startup; goose tracks applied versions in the database.
- The SQLite Go driver is **`modernc.org/sqlite`** (pure Go, no CGO). Do not use `mattn/go-sqlite3`.
- Database queries use **`sqlc`** for type-safe Go code generated from SQL. Write SQL in query files alongside migrations; run codegen when queries change. Generated code lives in `backend/internal/db/`; do not edit generated files by hand.
- Raw `database/sql` is used as the underlying interface; `sqlc` generates the typed wrappers.

## API Conventions

- Real endpoints live under `/api/v1`.
- DTOs stay near HTTP handlers.
- Business rules belong in application services.
- Database access belongs behind repository-style functions or methods.
- Error responses should be structured, consistent, and safe for user display.
- Error response shape is a JSON envelope: `{"error": {"code": "STABLE_CODE", "message": "human-readable detail"}}`. The `code` field is a stable uppercase string that the frontend translation layer keys off of. Never return raw Go error strings to the client.
- Public request and response shapes should be documented in OpenAPI as endpoints become real.
- Date fields in request and response bodies use ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for calendar dates and RFC 3339 for timestamps, consistent with the data layer convention.
- List endpoints that can return large result sets must use **cursor-based pagination**, not offset pagination. Cursors must be stable under concurrent inserts. Return `next_cursor` in the response; a missing or null `next_cursor` means the last page.
- Transaction list endpoints must support a `search` query parameter backed by **SQLite FTS5** on the backend. Do not implement client-side full-text search over server-fetched pages.

## Frontend Conventions

- SvelteKit builds static output with `@sveltejs/adapter-static`; production does not run a SvelteKit server.
- Do not add `+page.server.ts`, `+layout.server.ts`, `+server.ts`, SvelteKit form actions, or production server hooks without first accepting an ADR that changes the runtime shape.
- Frontend routes may rely on the Go static handler's SPA fallback for extensionless browser paths. Missing asset-like paths with file extensions should 404.
- All production data access goes through Go API endpoints under `/api/v1`; unknown `/api/` paths must not fall back to the frontend shell.
- The frontend i18n library is **Paraglide JS** (Inlang). Use its compile-time message functions for all user-facing copy.
- Backend translation (export file headers, server-generated content) is deferred to Phase 3. When needed, use `nicksnyder/go-i18n` with JSON message files.
- All user-facing copy goes through a translation boundary.
- English is the initial implementation language.
- UI code and built-in app-defined data must stay ready for additional languages without route, component, or schema rewrites.
- Do not concatenate translated fragments to form sentences.
- Formatting of numbers, dates, percentages, and money must be locale-aware and separate from message translation.
- Use **Dinero.js v2** for all frontend money arithmetic and display (balance checks before submission, running totals, input parsing). Use `Intl.NumberFormat` via Dinero's formatting layer for locale-aware rendering.
- Backend money arithmetic uses **`shopspring/decimal`**. All canonical balance and report calculations happen in Go, not in the browser.
- Themes must use semantic design tokens for color, spacing, typography, elevation, and motion.
- Themes start with light and dark only.
- Theme names and token roles must stay stable even if visual styling evolves.
- New screens must define loading, empty, error, and success states.
- New interactions must be keyboard-usable and accessible.
- Responsive behavior must be deliberate on both desktop and mobile.
- Prefer shared frontend helpers and API seams over route-local ad hoc logic.
- Use **`openapi-typescript`** (type generation) + **`openapi-fetch`** (typed HTTP client) for all frontend API calls. The OpenAPI spec is the single source of type truth.
- Use **`@tanstack/svelte-query`** as the data layer for all server state. Use `createInfiniteQuery` for paginated lists; use query key composition to cache search results per search string.
- Use **`minisearch`** for client-side fuzzy filtering of small in-memory sets (account name dropdowns, payee autocomplete). Do not use client-side search for full transaction lists.
- Use **`date-fns` v3** for all frontend date manipulation (parsing, arithmetic, formatting helpers). Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for final locale-aware display output. Do not use `luxon`, `moment`, or the browser `Date` constructor for financial date logic.
- All new frontend files must be **TypeScript** (`.ts`, `.svelte` with `<script lang="ts">`). No JavaScript-only files in `frontend/src`.
- Component state uses **Svelte 5 runes** (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`). Cross-component and cross-route shared state uses `$state` in `.svelte.ts` module files. No Svelte 4 stores (`writable`, `readable`, `derived` from `svelte/store`) in new code.

## Design Conventions

- Aim for calm, trustworthy financial software rather than generic dashboard styling.
- Use clear information hierarchy, explicit totals, and obvious destructive-action warnings.
- Preserve readability for dense ledger and reporting screens.
- Charts and color usage must remain understandable in all supported themes.
- Theme support should include a non-color cue strategy for critical financial states such as positive, negative, warning, reconciled, and locked.

## Security And Deployment Conventions

- Treat local-network deployment as safer than public deployment, but never as fully trusted.
- Local authentication must exist before real data entry.
- First-run setup is browser-based and creates the single owner with a username and password.
- Session management uses **HTTP-only secure cookies** backed by a **SQLite session table**. Sessions are revocable by deleting the row. Do not use JWTs for session tokens.
- Session tokens are opaque random values. Store only token hashes in SQLite.
- Session cookies use `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Path=/`, and no `Domain`. Use `Secure` whenever the app is served over HTTPS. HTTPS deployments should use a `__Host-` prefixed cookie name once auth implementation lands.
- CSRF protection for mutating API requests uses SameSite cookies as a baseline plus server-side `Origin` validation and a session-bound or signed CSRF token sent in a custom header such as `X-CSRF-Token`.
- `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` endpoints must not mutate durable state.
- Password hashing uses **`golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt`**. Never store plaintext or weakly hashed passwords.
- Public deployment requires HTTPS and explicit operator guidance.
- Public VPS deployment with real financial data requires MFA.
- Localhost development may use HTTP.
- LAN/private-network deployments should use HTTPS and may use either a reverse proxy or app-provided certificate and key configuration. Browser-warning-free LAN/private HTTPS requires either a real trusted certificate for a domain or installing a trusted local certificate authority on every client device.
- Local-network use may ship before MFA if authentication and operator guidance are clear.
- SQLite database encryption is deferred for early local use, but docs must explain when encrypted-at-rest storage may be needed.
- Docker Compose must package the same app shape as the single binary.
- The Docker production image uses **`gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12`** as the base. Since `modernc.org/sqlite` is pure Go with no CGO, no libc is required.
- SQLite data must live in persistent storage outside the container image or binary.
- Backup and restore instructions are part of product documentation, not only operator folklore.
- Operator backups do not replace user-facing export features.

## Observability Conventions

- Use **`log/slog`** (Go stdlib) for all structured logging. Output JSON in production, text in development. No third-party logging library.
- Log at `Info` for normal request lifecycle events, `Warn` for recoverable anomalies, `Error` for failures that need operator attention.
- Do not log financial record content (amounts, payees, account names) at any level.
- The application mode is controlled by the **`APP_ENV`** environment variable. Accepted values: `development`, `production`. Default to `production` when unset. Mode gates log format (text vs JSON) and any dev-only middleware.
- HTTP middleware layers run in a consistent order per request: request ID injection → request logging → auth check → handler. Each layer is a plain `http.Handler` wrapper; no framework-specific middleware interface.
- A request-scoped UUID is generated for every inbound request, included in all log entries for that request, and echoed in the `X-Request-ID` response header.
- The HTTP server must handle `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` with `http.Server.Shutdown(ctx)` and a short grace period before exiting.

## Infrastructure And Port Conventions

- Backend dev server listens on **`:16888`** (via `HTTP_ADDR` env var).
- Frontend dev server (SvelteKit + Vite) listens on **`:1888`** and proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:16888`.
- Production single binary and Docker container serve on **`:16888`**.
- Production static frontend files are copied from `frontend/build/` into `backend/internal/web/dist/` before compiling the Go binary.
- Entity IDs in SQLite use **auto-increment integers** (`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`). External-facing identifiers in API responses may use integers directly; do not convert to UUIDs unless a later ADR introduces distributed ID requirements.

## Scope Conventions

- User-facing export support must include core ledger CSV and QIF in the first export milestone.
- Attachments are out of scope until explicitly brought in by a later requirement or ADR.
- Mobile support must cover full core workflows responsively, including transaction entry.
- User and permission naming may stay explicitly single-user until shared workflows become active scope.

## Testing Conventions

- Backend behavior gets Go tests.
- Use **`testify`** (`testify/assert` for non-fatal checks, `testify/require` for fatal checks) in all Go tests. Do not write verbose `if got != want` assertion blocks.
- Frontend logic gets Svelte checks and focused component or unit tests when introduced.
- Bruno covers important API workflows.
- Playwright covers critical user journeys.
- Financial invariants, reconciliation behavior, imports, and calculations require named backend test cases.

## Archive Translation Rules

- Do not port desktop-only features without re-justifying them for web and self-hosted deployment.
- Do not copy Python, Rust, or Tauri implementation details directly into Go or SvelteKit without confirming the underlying requirement still matters.
- When archive documents conflict with active docs, active docs win.
- If an archive idea is adopted, rewrite it in current-stack terms and add it to active docs.

## Documentation Conventions

- Requirements belong in `docs/product-requirements.md`.
- Long-lived architectural constraints belong in `docs/early-architecture-decisions.md`.
- Sequencing belongs in `docs/product-requirements.md`.
- Decision records belong in `docs/adrs/`.
- Repo-wide agent guidance belongs in `AGENTS.md`.
- Developer workflow notes belong in `README.md` and `docs/developer-workflow.md` unless a tooling area needs substantial local guidance.
- Placeholder README files are acceptable for ignored or generated directories that must remain present in Git.
