# Technical Backlog

This is the **live** technical-debt list: items that are actionable now and are
not already scheduled as product work. It is intentionally short.

- **Feature sequence:** `docs/roadmap.md`.
- **Short-horizon queue:** `docs/todo.md`.
- **Shipped capability:** `docs/implemented.md`.
- **Resolved and deliberate decisions:** `docs/reviews/resolved-backlog-2026-07.md`.

Status legend: `[ ]` open.

## General

### T-34 No producer of investment provider events/suggestions `[ ]`

**Files:** `backend/internal/app/investments.go` (`DividendProvider`,
`CorporateActionProvider` interfaces, declared but never implemented or
referenced); `investment_provider_events` / `investment_event_suggestions`
tables (`backend/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql`).

Verified 2026-07-15 (Workstream 3 investment test coverage): nothing in the
codebase writes to `investment_provider_events` or
`investment_event_suggestions` — no fetcher, worker, or import path creates
them. The review UI and the accept/ignore/automation-rules endpoints all work
correctly (fixed the same day — see below), but have no data to act on until
a producer exists. `docs/product-requirements.md` lists "provider events and
reviewable suggestions" as a real requirement. Needs: a chosen data source
(no candidate picked yet), a fetch/detection design, and — separately — a
lot-mutation design for structural corporate actions (split, merger,
spin_off, ticker_change, delisting, `corporate_action`), which
`AcceptSuggestion` currently rejects outright since only the
`dividend_income` proposed-transaction kind (dividend, distribution,
cash_in_lieu, return_of_capital) is implemented.

## Public-deployment security gates

These do not block private/local development. They must be complete before
allowing real financial data on an internet-exposed deployment.

### S-04 Username login throttle can cause owner lockout `[ ]`

**File:** `backend/internal/app/auth.go` (username-scope throttle).

An internet attacker can keep the known single-owner username rate-limited.
Design and implement an approved-device cookie or equivalent lockout-safe
throttle before public beta.

### S-06 Multi-factor authentication `[ ]`

**File:** `docs/product-requirements.md` (public-deployment requirement).

Public deployment with real financial data remains prohibited until MFA has an
approved design and implementation. Select and implement TOTP, WebAuthn, or an
approved equivalent before lifting this product gate.
